##### Why the result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana?
.toLowerCase function only exists on strings. `+'a'` resolves to NaN ("Not a Number") because it force a string to a number
(as s using `+` before any value in JavaScript will convert that value to a number), 
and here  `line3` the character `a` cannot be parsed as a number. So we have `baNaN`.
It will concatenate `a` to `baNaN` and at the with applying `.toLowerCase` we have `banana`.


```

> 'b' 
"b" 
    
> 'b' + 'a' 
"ba"

// *** line3 *** 
>'b' + 'a' + + 'a' 
"baNaN" 

>'b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a' 
"baNaNa" 

>('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() 
"banana"

```
